Customizing the Chatbot
You can easily customize the chatbot by adding new responses to predefined questions or changing the existing ones.

Example of Adding New Responses
To add or modify responses, go to the chatbot.js file and update the know object with more key-value pairs.

javascript
Copy code
var know = {
    "hi": "Hello, How are you!",
    "Who are you": "Hello, Chatbot here",
    "How are you": "Good :)",
    "Your followers": "I don't have followers, I have a supportive Family.",
    "Tell me a joke": "Why don't skeletons fight each other? Because they don't have the guts!",
    // Add more responses below
    "What's your favorite movie": "I don't watch movies, but I think you should check out something fun!",
};
Adding More Logic
You can improve the bot’s behavior by adding more complex logic, such as handling variations of user inputs (e.g., "Hi", "hello", "Hey") or making the chatbot smarter using regular expressions or string matching techniques.

Known Issues
This chatbot only responds to exact matches of predefined questions.
It does not have machine learning or AI capabilities; it is based on a static set of responses.
Future Improvements
Add more responses for a wider variety of questions.
Allow the chatbot to learn or be trained with new responses over time.
Implement natural language processing to handle varied user inputs.
